    About Me: I was born in Little Rock, Arkansas in April 2004. I have spent a lot of my life moving.
    My most recent move was in July 2018. <br> I currently go to Hoffman Estates High School. I did not go to preschool.
    I went to a private school for kindergarten <br> but only attended 6 months of school. I went to 1st and 2nd
    grade in India. I finished 2nd grade in Minnesota. <br> I attended 3rd grade at Hanover Highlands and I went to Hoover
    for 4-6 grade. I went to Jane Addams for 7th and 8th grade.
